## Project Information

This website is inspired by online electronics stores. In this case I made an example of a product page where you can see and read more indepth information about a product.

## Navigation

The page loads straight into the product page. Here you can interact with the navbar and scroll downwards for more information about the product. The storename header can be clicked to return to the main page (in this case, the product page). There is also a searchbar (non functional), a basket button that leads you to the basket/order page, and a my profile button (non functional).

In the basket page you have the order form where the user can fill in information for their order.
